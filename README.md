**Setup**

You will probably need to create the two directories at root app level:

 - uploads
 - processed

You will also need to create environment variables for the following:

 - PORT
 - REACT_APP_URL (this can be substituted for whichever front end you are using)
 - GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
 - GOOGLE_PROJECT_LOCATION
 - GOOGLE_DOCUMENT_PROCESSOR_ID
 - GCS_OUTPUT_BUCKET_URI
 - GCS_OUTPUT_BUCKET_PREFIX
 - GCS_INPUT_BUCKET_URI
 - VALID_KEYS
